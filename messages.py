                               of one of two possible outcomes. It models the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more \
                              independent variables using the logistic function. The logistic function maps any real-valued number into a value \
                              between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. Logistic Regression estimates the coefficients of the model \

    #### Group Fairness

    This metric checks if members of each group have the same probability of being assigned to the positive class.
    In our case we will define the positive class as being predicted having heart disease. 

    For example, if we investigate the group 'Sex' then coinciding Group Fairness metrics would imply that
    :blue-background[both groups have the same probability to receive an 'ill' prediction.] Mathematically this is stated as follows:
    
    P(Prediction = 1 | Sex = female) == P(Prediction = 1 | Sex = male)  

    If we calculate this probability for both groups we can then compare them and check if Group Fairness is present or not.

    #### Conditional Statistical Fairness

    This metric checks if members of each group have the same probability of being assigned to the positive class *under the same set of conditions*.

    For example, equal Conditional Statistical Fairness with respect to the 'fbs' feature would imply
    
    P(HeartDiseasePrediction = 1 | Sex = female, fbs = 1) == P(HeartDiseasePrediction = 1 | Sex = male, fbs = 1)

    This formula implies that :blue-background[both diabetic men and women have the same probability to receive an 'ill' prediction.]

    Group Fairness as well as the Conditional Statistical Fairness both only consider the predictions of the machine learning model. 
    The two upcoming metrics do additionally include the ground truth of each prediction.

    #### Predictive Parity

    Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability of a subject who is predicted as 'ill' to truly have heart disease.

    :blue-background[The PPV is calculated as:  True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)]

    A high PPV indicates that we can be sure that a positive prediction is true. Ideally this value is 1, then we can be certain that any positive prediction is true.
    
    :blue-background[Predcitive Parity checks whether men and women get the same values of PPV from model's predictions.]

    #### False Positive Error Rate Balance

    False Positive Rate (FPR) is the probability of a subject who is predicted as 'ill' to actually be healthy.

    :blue-background[The FPR is calculated as:  False Positives / (False Positives + True Negatives)]

    :blue-background[False Positive Error Rate Balance checks whether men and women get the same values of FPR from model's predictions.]
